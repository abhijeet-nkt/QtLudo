<h1>Understanding the project code</h1>
<p>Entire project is impemented in Object-orineted style. The headers
of classes have comments above the functions, discribing what they
do. Expressive code is not commented. Some smart actions have
comments inside the function definations. It is recommended that you
read the comment above function or class declaration before using it
